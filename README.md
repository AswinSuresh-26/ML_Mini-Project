# Credit Card Fraud Detection: Detailed Report

## 1. Overview
### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy. Fraud detection is crucial in the financial sector to prevent unauthorized transactions and safeguard user information.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various features related to credit card transactions. These features are engineered to capture the patterns and characteristics of both fraudulent and legitimate transactions. Some of the key features include:
- **distance_from_home**
- **ratio_to_median_purchase_price**
- **online_order**
- **used_chip**
- **used_pin_number**
- **repeat_retailer**
- **distance_from_last_transaction**

### Problem Statement
The challenge is to build a model that can effectively distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, minimizing false positives and false negatives.

## 2. Data Exploration
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the EDA phase, various statistical methods and visualizations were used to understand the dataset better. This included:
- **Distribution of Transactions**: Visualizing the distribution of fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Evaluating the correlation between different features to identify any multicollinearity.
- **Feature Analysis**: Assessing the impact of each feature on the target variable (fraud vs. non-fraud).

### Data Preprocessing
Key preprocessing steps included:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputing or removing missing data points.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to better capture transaction patterns.
- **Data Normalization**: Scaling features to ensure they are on the same scale, which is important for certain machine learning models.
- **Train-Test Split**: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, typically in a 70:30 ratio.

## 3. Modeling
### Model Selection
A Random Forest classifier was chosen due to its robustness and ability to handle large datasets with high-dimensional features. The model's hyperparameters were tuned for optimal performance, including:
- **Number of Estimators**: The number of trees in the forest.
- **Max Depth**: Maximum depth of each tree to prevent overfitting.
- **Min Samples Split**: Minimum number of samples required to split a node.

### Training
The model was trained using the training dataset. Cross-validation techniques were employed to ensure the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data.

## 4. Results
### Evaluation Metrics
The model was evaluated using various metrics:
- **Confusion Matrix**: 
  ```
  [[89992, 3],
   [0, 50005]]
  ```
  This shows a very high accuracy with minimal false positives and no false negatives.
  
- **Classification Report**:
  ```
  Precision: 1.00
  Recall: 1.00
  F1-Score: 1.00
  ```

- **Accuracy Score**:
  ```
  0.99998
  ```

### Feature Importance
Feature importance was analyzed to understand which features contributed most to the model's predictions:
- **ratio_to_median_purchase_price**: 0.5269
- **online_order**: 0.1704
- **distance_from_home**: 0.1324

### Model Persistence
The trained model was saved using the `joblib` library, allowing it to be loaded and used for predictions in the future.

## 5. Conclusion
### Summary
The Random Forest model demonstrated exceptional performance in detecting fraudulent transactions, achieving near-perfect accuracy. The most significant feature influencing the model's decision was the `ratio_to_median_purchase_price`, indicating that the amount spent relative to the median purchase price is a strong indicator of fraud.

### Future Work
To further improve the model, the following steps could be taken:
- **Handling Imbalanced Data**: Applying techniques like SMOTE to balance the dataset.
- **Model Ensemble**: Using an ensemble of different models to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Real-time Detection**: Implementing the model in a real-time fraud detection system.
